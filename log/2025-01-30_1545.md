# Progress Log: 2025-01-30 @ 15:45

## Session Summary

Initial project setup session. Established documentation, rules, and workflow conventions for the Act 22 fuzzy merge exercise.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Project Documentation Created
- **README.md** - Comprehensive project overview including:
  - Directory structure for both Dropbox (data) and GitHub (code) folders
  - Record counts: 1,532 records (2015-2018) + 877 records (2019) = 2,409 total
  - Data descriptions with key columns
  - Fuzzy merge challenge explanation
  - File descriptions table for all repository files

- **CLAUDE.md** - AI assistant rules established:
  - Rule 1: NEVER delete data, code, or files
  - Rule 2: Only work within two designated folders (Dropbox for reading, GitHub for writing)
  - Rule 3: Data flows from Dropbox (read) to GitHub (write)
  - Rule 4: Claude may stage/commit but NEVER push to GitHub

### 2. Progress Log System Created
- Created `log/` directory
- Created `log/log.md` explaining the log system
- Created this first log entry

### 3. Git Commits Made (not yet pushed)
1. "Add project documentation: README.md and CLAUDE.md"
2. "Add Rule 4: Claude may not push to GitHub"
3. "Expand README with detailed GitHub folder documentation"
4. (Pending) Log system files

## Files Created/Modified This Session

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `README.md` | Created/Updated |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Created/Updated |
| `log/log.md` | Created |
| `log/2025-01-30_1545.md` | Created (this file) |

## Current Project Status

- **Phase:** Setup complete, ready to begin fuzzy merge work
- **Data explored:** Yes - reviewed structure of both CSV files
- **Code written:** None yet (existing Stata files were pre-existing)

## Next Steps

1. Begin the actual fuzzy merge exercise
2. Decide on approach:
   - Language to use (Python, R, or Stata?)
   - Matching strategy (location + financial profile? other?)
3. Explore the 2019 data file structure in more detail

## Open Questions

- What matching variables should we prioritize for the fuzzy merge?
- Should we use Python (pandas + fuzzy matching libraries), R, or continue with Stata?
- What constitutes a "successful" match?
